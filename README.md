# Descritiption

This code is an implementation of the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm for clustering data points into different classes. The SOM algorithm is used to map the input data onto a two-dimensional grid, where each cell in the grid represents a cluster. The algorithm is trained on a set of input data points, and then used to predict the cluster for new data points.

The code generates a random dataset of 210 rows and 7 columns, where each row represents a data point and each column represents a feature. The target variable is generated by randomly assigning each data point to one of three classes. The data is then normalized to have zero mean and unit variance.

The code then trains an SOM on the data using the MiniSom library. The SOM is trained for 10,000 iterations with a learning rate of 0.5 and a Gaussian neighborhood function. The code then visualizes the clusters for two different numbers of classes (6 and 7). The visualizations show the data points mapped onto the two-dimensional grid, with each cell in the grid representing a cluster. The centroids of each cluster are also shown as red x's.

The code also generates a set of 5 random test samples, which are visualized along with the training and test data points. This allows the user to evaluate the performance of the SOM algorithm on new, unseen data.
